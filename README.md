# App to create a To-Do List

This App was developed during a class offered by Digital Innovation One.

The original code is from [Ezequiel Messore](https://github.com/EzequielMessore/To-Do-List),
but the improvements and adaptations are mine.

## The App

It's an App programmed in Kotlin in which users can register tasks with a specified date and time.

## Stack

- **Lifecycle** to work with LiveData and ViewModels
- **Room** to work with database

## My contributions

Originally, the records were lost when closing the App, but now they are stored in a database. To manage
this process, I chose to work with Room.

I also localized the App for Brazilian Portuguese and English.
